This project replicates the look and feel of Swiggy’s landing page using pure HTML and CSS. It includes a navigation bar, search section, horizontally scrollable food categories, Instamart product list, city delivery grid, and footer – all styled to resemble the actual website.
This is a non-commercial project and is intended only for learning and showcasing frontend development skills.
